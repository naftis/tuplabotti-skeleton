## Developing

### Adding commands

Commands are supposed to be added to `./commands/` as _.ts_ files. You can use `Greeter.ts` as an example of a ICommand function.

When you have finished creating your command, you can add it to `./command.ts` to `getCommand()` function, which returns a list that Tuplabotti iterates through when starting to listen for messages.

### Adding startup tasks

Append the list in `./command.ts`'s `getStartupTasks()` with your function which returns a `Promise`.
